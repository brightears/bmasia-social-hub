# Health Check Fixes for BMA Social API on Render

## Problem
The BMA Social API was failing health checks on Render with timeout errors. The health check endpoint was taking too long to respond because it was:
1. Checking database, Redis, and external API connections synchronously
2. Calling async methods incorrectly (causing failures)
3. Not handling initialization failures gracefully

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fast Basic Health Check Endpoint (`/health`)
- **Purpose**: Used by Render for health checks
- **Response Time**: < 100ms
- **Dependencies**: None
- **Returns**: Simple status without checking dependencies
```json
{
    "status": "healthy",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "environment": "production"
}
```

### 2. New Health Check Endpoints

#### `/health/live` - Liveness Check
- **Purpose**: Verify the application process is alive
- **Response Time**: < 100ms
- **Use Case**: Container orchestration liveness probes

#### `/ready` - Readiness Check
- **Purpose**: Check if app is ready to serve traffic
- **Response Time**: < 3 seconds
- **Checks**: Database connectivity and Redis (with timeouts)
- **Use Case**: Determine when to route traffic to the instance

#### `/health/detailed` - Detailed Health Check
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive health status for debugging
- **Response Time**: Variable (may be slow)
- **Checks**: All dependencies including external APIs
- **Use Case**: Debugging and detailed monitoring

### 3. Graceful Initialization
- Services now initialize with error handling
- App starts even if some services fail to initialize
- Failed services can retry on first use

### 4. Middleware Optimizations
- Health check endpoints bypass rate limiting
- Health check endpoints skip verbose logging
- Added error handling to prevent middleware hangs

## Testing the Fixes

### Local Testing
```bash
# Start the API locally
cd backend
uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

# In another terminal, run the test script
python test_health_endpoints.py http://localhost:8000
```

### Production Testing
```bash
# Test the deployed Render service
python test_health_endpoints.py https://bma-social-api-q9uu.onrender.com
```

### Manual Testing with curl
```bash
# Test basic health check (should be < 1 second)
time curl https://bma-social-api-q9uu.onrender.com/health

# Test liveness check
curl https://bma-social-api-q9uu.onrender.com/health/live

# Test readiness check
curl https://bma-social-api-q9uu.onrender.com/ready

# Test detailed health (may be slower)
curl https://bma-social-api-q9uu.onrender.com/health/detailed
```

## Expected Behavior

1. **On Startup**:
   - `/health` returns 200 immediately (even if DB/Redis not ready)
   - `/ready` returns 503 until critical services are ready
   - App continues starting even if some services fail

2. **During Normal Operation**:
   - `/health` always returns 200 quickly
   - `/ready` returns 200 if DB is accessible
   - `/health/detailed` provides full service status

3. **During Issues**:
   - `/health` still returns 200 (app is running)
   - `/ready` returns 503 if DB is down
   - `/health/detailed` shows which services are failing

## Render Configuration
The `render.yaml` is already configured correctly with:
```yaml
healthCheckPath: /health
```

## Monitoring Best Practices

### For Render/Load Balancers
- Use `/health` endpoint
- Set timeout to 10 seconds
- Check interval: 30 seconds

### For Kubernetes/Container Orchestration
- Liveness Probe: `/health/live` (timeout: 5s, period: 10s)
- Readiness Probe: `/ready` (timeout: 10s, period: 15s)
- Startup Probe: `/health` (timeout: 10s, period: 10s, failureThreshold: 30)

### For Application Monitoring
- Use `/health/detailed` for comprehensive checks
- Poll every 60 seconds
- Alert on specific service failures

## Troubleshooting

### If health checks still timeout:
1. Check network connectivity to database/Redis
2. Verify environment variables are set correctly
3. Check logs for initialization errors
4. Ensure sufficient memory/CPU allocated

### If services show as unhealthy:
1. Check individual service connectivity
2. Verify credentials and connection strings
3. Check service logs for errors
4. Use `/health/detailed` for specific error messages

## Code Changes Summary

1. **`/backend/app/main.py`**:
   - Split health check into multiple endpoints
   - Added graceful error handling in startup
   - Fixed async/sync issues
   - Optimized middleware for health checks

2. **New Endpoints**:
   - `/health` - Basic check (no dependencies)
   - `/health/live` - Liveness check
   - `/ready` - Readiness check with timeouts
   - `/health/detailed` - Full dependency checks

3. **Test Script**:
   - `/backend/test_health_endpoints.py` - Automated testing of all health endpoints

## Deploy Instructions

1. Commit the changes:
```bash
git add backend/app/main.py backend/test_health_endpoints.py backend/HEALTH_CHECK_FIXES.md
git commit -m "Fix health check timeouts for Render deployment"
git push
```

2. Render will automatically deploy if auto-deploy is enabled

3. Monitor the deployment logs in Render dashboard

4. Once deployed, verify with:
```bash
python backend/test_health_endpoints.py https://bma-social-api-q9uu.onrender.com
```
