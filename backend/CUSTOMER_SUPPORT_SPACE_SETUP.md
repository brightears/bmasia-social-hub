# Setting Up Dedicated Customer Support Space in Google Chat

## Perfect! A Dedicated Space for Customer Support

Having a separate Google Chat space for customer support is the ideal setup. Here's how to organize it:

## 1. Create the New Space

### Space Setup:
1. **Space Name:** "BMA Customer Support" (or "BMA WhatsApp Support")
2. **Description:** "Live customer support conversations from WhatsApp/LINE"
3. **Space Type:** Regular space (not announcement)
4. **Members:** 
   - Support team members
   - Operations team (for technical issues)
   - Managers (for escalations)

### Space Features to Enable:
- ✅ Threaded conversations (IMPORTANT - each customer gets their own thread)
- ✅ Allow apps and bots
- ✅ History on (to keep conversation records)

## 2. How It Will Work

### Customer Conversation Flow:
```
Customer (WhatsApp): "Hi, the music stopped at our venue"
↓
Bot creates new thread in Google Chat:
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 🆕 New Support Request #1234        │
│ Customer: John Doe (+60123456789)   │
│ Venue: Café Milano                  │
│ Platform: WhatsApp                  │
│ ─────────────────────────────────   │
│ Message: "Hi, the music stopped at  │
│ our venue"                          │
│                                     │
│ 💬 Reply in this thread to respond  │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

Team Member replies: "Hi John! I'm checking this now..."
↓
Customer receives on WhatsApp: "Hi John! I'm checking this now..."
```

## 3. Conversation Management Features

### Each Thread Will Show:
- **Customer Name & Phone**
- **Venue Name** (if identified)
- **Platform** (WhatsApp/LINE)
- **Conversation ID** (for tracking)
- **Status** (New/In Progress/Resolved)
- **Assigned To** (optional)

### Thread Updates:
- New messages from customer appear in same thread
- Team can see full conversation history
- Multiple team members can collaborate
- Thread closes when issue resolved

## 4. Smart Features We Can Add

### Auto-Actions:
- **@mention** specific team members based on issue type
- **Auto-assign** to available support agent
- **Escalate** to managers for VIP venues
- **Tag** conversations (Technical/Sales/General)

### Quick Replies:
Team can use shortcuts like:
- `/resolve` - Marks issue as resolved
- `/escalate` - Escalates to manager
