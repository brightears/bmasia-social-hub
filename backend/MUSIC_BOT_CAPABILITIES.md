# BMA Social Music Bot Capabilities

Last Updated: 2025-01-04

## Overview

The bot intelligently handles two different music platforms with platform-specific approaches:

## 1. Soundtrack Your Brand (SYB) Venues

### What the Bot CAN Do:

#### ‚úÖ Detection & Monitoring
- Find zones by venue name
- Check zone online/offline status  
- Detect if zone has a schedule
- Identify scheduled vs manual mode
- Retrieve playlist history (past 3 weeks)
- Show current playlist name (but not track details)

#### ‚úÖ Schedule Analysis
- Retrieve weekly schedule if configured
- Show today's playlist rotation
- Analyze schedule patterns
- Provide design insights based on:
  - Playlist variety
  - Weekend vs weekday differences
  - Volume recommendations
  - Historical patterns

#### ‚úÖ Design Conversations
- Suggest mood-appropriate playlists
- Time-aware recommendations (morning/afternoon/evening)
- Venue-type specific suggestions (bar/restaurant/lobby/spa)
- Structured escalation to design team

### What the Bot CAN Do (with compatible devices):

#### ‚úÖ Volume Control (CONFIRMED WORKING!)
- **CAN adjust volume** on zones with IPAM400 devices
- Uses 0-16 scale (SYB standard)
- Instant changes via API
- Automatic device compatibility checking

### What the Bot CANNOT Do (Current Limitations):

#### ‚ùå Limited Control
- Cannot change playlists programmatically (yet)
- Cannot switch between scheduled/manual modes
- Cannot pause/resume playback  
- Cannot access full playlist catalog
- Cannot see current track details
- **Cannot control Samsung tablet zones** (display-only devices)

### Smart Workaround:
```
Customer: "Music is too boring"
Bot: Suggests 5 energetic playlists
Customer: "Yes, change it"
Bot: Notifies design team via Google Chat
Design Team: Implements in SYB dashboard within 30 mins
```

## 2. Beat Breeze Venues

### Characteristics:
- **NO API AVAILABLE** - Cannot check real-time status
- Design specifications stored in `music_design.md`
- Shows what SHOULD be playing (not what IS playing)
- Venue staff must check/adjust on-site

### Bot Response for Beat Breeze:
```
üìã Beat Breeze Design for [Zone]:
Current time slot:
‚Ä¢ Playlist: Morning Vibes
‚Ä¢ Energy: Low
‚Ä¢ Volume: Level 8

Note: Beat Breeze designs are managed directly. 
Contact your venue manager for schedule changes.
(Cannot verify actual playback - no API available)
```
