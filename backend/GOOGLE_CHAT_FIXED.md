# Google Chat Integration Fixed! ✅

## What Was The Problem?
The Google Chat notifications stopped working because the service account credentials were lost during a redeploy on Render. The original service account (`bma-social-service`) no longer existed.

## How We Fixed It

### 1. Created New Service Account
- **Service Account:** `bma-social-chat@bmasia-social-hub.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
- **Project:** `bmasia-social-hub`
- **Role:** Chat Apps Owner

### 2. Added Credentials Locally
- Added `GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_JSON` to `.env` file (formatted as single-line JSON with `\n` for newlines)

### 3. Added Credentials to Render
- Added the same `GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_JSON` environment variable to Render
- Service automatically redeployed

## Current Status
✅ **WORKING** - Google Chat notifications are now operational!

- Local testing: ✅ Successful
- Render deployment: ✅ Live and working
- Google Chat client: ✅ Initialized successfully

## When Notifications Are Sent
The bot sends notifications to the "BMAsia Working Group" space when:
- Customers request playlist changes (licensing limitations)
- Technical issues occur
- Human assistance is needed
- Any request requires manual intervention

## Test It
Send a WhatsApp message to the bot asking to change playlists, and you'll see a notification in Google Chat!

## Important Notes
- Service account credentials are now properly configured
- No webhook needed - using service account authentication
- Notifications go to: `spaces/AAQA3gAn8GY` (BMAsia Working Group)
