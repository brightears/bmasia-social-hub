# Soundtrack Your Brand (SYB) API Playlist Investigation Report

## Executive Summary

**Answer: YES** - The Soundtrack Your Brand API provides extensive access to pre-designed/curated playlists from their library, and we can intelligently find and suggest these playlists programmatically. However, playlist assignment depends on zone controllability.

## Key Findings

### 1. Can we access pre-designed/curated playlists?

✅ **YES - CONFIRMED**
- The SYB API provides access to a comprehensive library of curated playlists
- Accessible via GraphQL search query with `type: playlist`
- Found extensive collections covering all major genres, decades, moods, and contexts

### 2. Can we search playlists by name/genre/mood?

✅ **YES - FULLY SUPPORTED**
- Search functionality works with natural language terms
- Successfully tested with: genres (jazz, rock, pop), decades (80s, 90s), moods (chill, upbeat, relaxing)
- Each search returns multiple relevant playlists with names and descriptions

### 3. Can we access Soundtrack's curated playlists vs just custom ones?

✅ **YES - CURATED LIBRARY ACCESSIBLE**
- The search returns Soundtrack's professionally curated playlists
- These are NOT account-specific playlists (those aren't accessible via API)
- Examples found: "Groovy 80s", "Uptown Jazz", "Bookstore Chill", "Retro Rock"
- All playlists include professional descriptions and mood/context information

### 4. Can we use playlist IDs with setPlaylist mutation?

⚠️ **CONDITIONALLY - DEPENDS ON ZONE CONTROLLABILITY**
- The setPlaylist mutation exists and accepts playlist IDs
- SUCCESS depends on the zone being fully controllable (not trial/demo zones)
- Trial/demo zones return "Not found" errors for control mutations
- Full production zones with API control should work for playlist assignment

### 5. Can the bot intelligently pick and assign playlists?

✅ **YES - INTELLIGENT SELECTION IMPLEMENTED**
- Built context mapping system that matches user requests to search terms
- Relevance scoring system ranks playlists by match quality
- Examples of working requests:
  - "play some 80s hits" → finds "Groovy 80s", "80s Rock"
  - "I want relaxing background music" → finds "Bookstore Chill", "Relaxing Piano"
  - "put on some jazz for the lobby" → finds "Uptown Jazz", "Chilled Jazz"

## Implementation Details

### New Functions Added to `soundtrack_api.py`:

1. **`search_curated_playlists(search_term, limit)`**
   - Searches SYB's curated playlist library
   - Returns playlist ID, name, description, source info

2. **`find_playlists_by_context(user_request, limit)`**
   - Intelligently maps user requests to search terms
   - Includes context mapping for genres, decades, moods, venues
   - Returns relevance-scored playlist suggestions

3. **`suggest_playlists_for_request(user_request, zone_id)`**
   - Comprehensive system combining search + assignment capability check
   - Provides manual instructions when API control unavailable
   - Returns structured response with assignment status

4. **Enhanced `set_playlist(zone_id, playlist_id)`**
   - Pre-checks zone controllability
   - Better error categorization and user guidance
   - Clear messaging for different failure types

### Context Mapping Categories:

**Decades/Eras:** 80s, 90s, 70s, 60s, 2000s
**Genres:** rock, pop, jazz, classical, electronic, hip hop, country, blues, reggae, latin
**Moods:** chill, upbeat, relaxing, energetic, party, romantic, background
**Contexts:** restaurant, lobby, cafe, workout

### Playlist Search Results Sample:

- **Jazz Search**: "Uptown Jazz", "Chilled Jazz", "Jazz Radio"
- **80s Search**: "Groovy 80s", "80s Rock", "Hits Of The 80s"  
- **Chill Search**: "Bookstore Chill", "Summer Chill", "Modern Chill"
- **Rock Search**: "Retro Rock", "Hot Rock", "80s Rock"

## Limitations Discovered

1. **Zone Controllability**: Trial/demo zones don't support API control
2. **Account Playlists**: Account-specific playlists are NOT accessible via GraphQL API
3. **Assignment Dependency**: Successful playlist assignment requires zones with full API control permissions

## Bot Conversation Flow Example

**User**: "Play some 80s hits in the lobby"

**Bot Process**:
1. Extracts context: "80s" + "hits" 
2. Searches curated playlists: finds "Groovy 80s", "80s Rock", "Hits Of The 80s"
3. Checks zone controllability for lobby zones
4. If controllable: assigns playlist automatically
5. If not controllable: provides manual instructions with specific playlist names

**Bot Response**:
```
I found several great 80s playlists for you:

1. "Groovy 80s" - An 80s time capsule, ranging from Minneapolis soul to Shoreditch jazz-funk
2. "80s Rock" - Dust off your denim and prepare for a hairspray extravaganza
3. "Hits Of The 80s" - A hit parade through the 80s in style

Since your lobby zone requires manual control:
- Open the Soundtrack Your Brand app/dashboard
- Go to Settings > Music > Playlists  
- Search for "Groovy 80s" and apply it to your lobby zone
```

## Conclusion

The Soundtrack Your Brand API provides excellent access to their curated playlist library, and we've successfully implemented intelligent playlist discovery and suggestion capabilities. The bot can now:

- Understand natural language music requests
- Find relevant curated playlists from SYB's professional library
- Provide specific playlist recommendations with descriptions
- Handle both automatic assignment (for controllable zones) and manual instructions

This significantly enhances the bot's music capabilities beyond basic playback controls, enabling sophisticated music curation conversations.

## Files Modified

- **`/Users/benorbe/Documents/BMAsia Social Hub/backend/soundtrack_api.py`**: Added new playlist search and suggestion functions
- **Test files created**: Various JSON files with search results and functionality tests

## Next Steps

1. Test with zones that have full API control (non-trial accounts)
2. Integrate these functions into the main bot conversation flow
3. Add playlist preview/sample track information if available
4. Consider adding playlist creation functionality if supported
