# How to Get the Space ID for "BMA Customer Support"

## You need to get the space ID for the new space. Here's how:

### Method 1: From the URL (Easiest)
1. In Google Chat, click on "BMA Customer Support" space
2. Look at your browser's URL bar
3. It should look like: `https://mail.google.com/chat/u/0/#chat/space/SPACE_ID_HERE`
4. Copy the part after `/space/` - that's your space ID

### Method 2: From Space Details
1. In the "BMA Customer Support" space
2. Click the space name at the top
3. Click "View space details" 
4. The space ID might be shown there

### Method 3: Using Google Chat API
If you can't find it in the UI, we can use the API to list all spaces and find it.

## Once You Have the Space ID

The space ID will look something like: `spaces/AAAA1234567` 

Send it to me and I'll:
1. Update the configuration files
2. Add the bot to the new space
3. Implement the two-way communication

## Current Space IDs:
- Old space (BMAsia Working Group): `spaces/AAQA3gAn8GY`
- New space (BMA Customer Support): `spaces/[NEED THIS ID]`
