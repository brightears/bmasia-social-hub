# Future Features Roadmap for BMA Social Bot

## 📁 Google Drive Integration (Contracts)

### Purpose
Enable the bot to search and retrieve actual contract PDFs and documents when discussing renewals or pricing.

### Implementation Plan
```python
# When user asks about contract details
"Can you show me our current contract?"
Bot: [Searches Google Drive for "Hilton Pattaya Contract"]
Bot: "I found your current contract (expires 31/10/2025):
      📄 Hilton_Pattaya_Contract_2019-2025.pdf
      Key terms: 5 zones, $X monthly, auto-renewal clause..."
```

### Features
- Search contracts by venue name
- Extract key information (dates, pricing, terms)
- Provide summary without sharing sensitive details publicly
- Direct link for authorized users

### Security
- Read-only access to specific Contract folder
- Only show to verified users

## 📚 Google Drive Integration (Technical Documentation)

### Purpose
Give the bot comprehensive product knowledge from technical docs, manuals, and guides.

### Implementation Plan
```python
# Bot will have access to:
/BMA Technical Docs/
  ├── Soundtrack Setup Guides/
  ├── Zone Configuration/
  ├── Troubleshooting Manuals/
  ├── API Documentation/
  └── Hardware Specs/
```

### Use Cases
- "How do I configure a new zone?"
  → Bot retrieves zone setup guide
- "What are the speaker specifications for Edge?"
  → Bot finds hardware documentation
- "How do I troubleshoot offline zones?"
  → Bot provides step-by-step guide from docs

### Benefits
- Always up-to-date information
- Consistent support across all agents
- No need to retrain bot when docs update

## 💬 Google Chat Integration (Department Notifications)

### Purpose
Allow the bot to escalate urgent issues to specific departments via Google Chat.

### Implementation Plan
```python
class GoogleChatNotifier:
    DEPARTMENTS = {
        'technical': 'spaces/AAAAxxxxxx',  # Tech support space
        'sales': 'spaces/BBBBxxxxxx',      # Sales team space
        'management': 'spaces/CCCCxxxxxx', # Management space
        'urgent': 'spaces/DDDDxxxxxx'      # Urgent issues space
    }
    
    def escalate_to_department(issue_type, venue, description):
        # Bot detects critical issue
        if "all zones offline" in description:
            send_to_chat(
                space='technical',
                message=f"🚨 URGENT: All zones offline at {venue}\n{description}"
            )
```

### Trigger Examples

#### Technical Escalation
```
User: "All our zones have been offline for 2 hours!"
Bot: "I'm escalating this to our technical team immediately."
[Sends to Google Chat Tech Space]
```

#### Sales Opportunity
```
User: "We're opening 5 new locations next month"
Bot: "Great news! I'll notify our sales team right away."
[Sends to Google Chat Sales Space]
```

#### Contract Renewal Alert
```
User: "We'd like to discuss renewal terms"
Bot: "I'll have our account manager contact you."
[Sends to Google Chat Sales Space with context]
```
