# 🤖 BMA Social Intelligent Bot - Feature Summary

## ✨ What's New: Intelligent Multi-Source Data Integration

Your bot now **automatically** checks multiple data sources and intelligently combines the information to provide comprehensive answers. No manual actions or "CHECK_SHEETS" commands needed!

## 🎯 How It Works

### Automatic Source Selection
The bot intelligently decides which data source to use based on the query:

| Query Type | Primary Source | Additional Data |
|------------|---------------|-----------------|
| Contract/Renewal | Google Sheets | Zone count from Soundtrack |
| Contact Info | Google Sheets | Current zone status |
| What's Playing | Soundtrack API | Venue details from Sheets |
| Zone Status | Soundtrack API | Contract info from Sheets |
| Venue Details | Both Sources | Combined comprehensive view |

### Smart Data Combination
When you ask "Give me all information about our venue", the bot:
1. ✅ Pulls contract details from Google Sheets
2. ✅ Gets real-time zone status from Soundtrack
3. ✅ Combines both into one comprehensive response
4. ✅ Formats it beautifully with emojis and structure

## 📊 Data Sources

### Google Sheets provides:
- 📅 Contract expiry dates
- 👤 Contact information
- 📧 Email addresses
- 📞 Phone numbers
- 🏢 Business metadata
- 📝 Venue configuration

### Soundtrack API provides:
- 🎵 Currently playing tracks
- 🟢 Zone online/offline status
- 🎶 Playlist information
- 🔊 Real-time music data
- 🎮 Playback control
- 📡 Device status

## 🚀 Example Interactions

### Contract Query
```
User: "When does our contract expire?"
Bot: [Automatically checks Google Sheets]
     "Your contract expires on 31/10/2025..."
```

### Music Query
```
User: "What's playing at Edge?"
Bot: [Automatically checks Soundtrack API]
     "Now playing at Edge: Golden Hour by JVKE"
```

### Combined Query
```

Bot: [Checks BOTH sources and combines]
     "Contract expires: 31/10/2025
      Active zones: 4/5 online
      Currently playing in Edge: Golden Hour..."
```
